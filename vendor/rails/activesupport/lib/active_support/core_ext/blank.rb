class Object
  # An object is blank if it's false, empty, or a whitespace string.
  # For example, "", "   ", +nil+, [], and {} are blank.
  #
  # This simplifies
  #
  #   if !address.nil? && !address.empty?
  #
  # to
  #
  #   if !address.blank?
  def blank?
    respond_to?(:empty?) ? empty? : !self
  end
    
  # An object is present if it's not blank.
